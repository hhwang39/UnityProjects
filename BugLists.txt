bluetooth terminates if tries to connect more than once (not really, but just terminates). happens on my phone

1.popup menu shown in wrong position 
2.Moving when gui is on gives error
3.text are not in right position

5.slider sometimes does not come back
6. In finding minimum distance, 0 index is not minimum






Fixed
1. When touched quickly, it overrides card1, card2 //FIXED now waits
2. Touching problem. Sometimes it is not touched properly - I think it is collider prob + animation // FIXED IT WAS both mine and flip prob
3. The one on the top looks bigger than bottom //Fixed
1. Null Reference when you keep  clicking
Bluetooth bugs sending data back and forth
Color always Pink
bluetooth click will always enable it


Text disappear if moved to the right
user still can drag objects even though  

popup should disappear when is it done 

for loop insertion when there are one spot left or no spot left
and deleting front does not shift things up.
for loop removing doesn't shift it up



removing for loop  needs a id and remove both id


MathGame
bluetooth just closes by itself fixed - never change state before you changed everyhing


for loop start and end can messed up
Lists are not in the order that hae might want - Fine

4.fast touching it screws the whole sequence
